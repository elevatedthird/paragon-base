parameters:
  twig.config:
    # By setting 'debug: true', the 'auto_reload' and 'cache'
    # parameters are implicitly set to their defaults (true).
    # 'auto_reload' should handle the regeneration of twig
    # files for debugging, while leaving 'cache' set to true
    # will increase local performance.

    # See https://www.drupal.org/node/1903374#options to read
    # more about the performance benefits of these settings.
