These files are based on the core scaffold files found in `core/assets/scaffold/files`,
with some custom files, and are used when scaffolding a Composer-based project using
`drupal/core-composer-scaffold`. There are Paragon-specific customizations in these
files, but they should regularly be kept in sync with the core scaffolding files
to ensure necessary updates are maintained -- especially with important files,
such as settings.php and .htaccess.
