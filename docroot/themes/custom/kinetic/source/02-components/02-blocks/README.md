# Blocks

Blocks are the next level of abstraction above Composites. They are typically made up of multiple Composites and are used to build more complex Components.
Blocks are not to be confused with Drupal Blocks. Drupal Blocks are a CMS feature that allows content editors to place content in regions of a page. Blocks in this context are a design system concept.
