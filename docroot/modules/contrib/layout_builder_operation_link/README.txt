INTRODUCTION
------------

The Layout Builder Operation Link module adds a 'Layout' operation link to
Layout Builder-enabled content on Drupal administrative pages. This link saves
content editors a click/page load when they want to access an entity's layout
page directly without loading its edit page first.

This module adds the 'Layout' operation link to any bundle where Layout Builder
is enabled with overrides, which could include bundles belonging to the
following entity types:

 * Nodes
 * Users
 * Taxonomy
 * Media
 * And more

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the Layout Builder Drupal core module. This module requires
no modules outside of Drupal core.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled, a 'Layout' operations link is added to the operation links for
override-enabled Layout Builder-enabled bundles. An example of where this is
useful is the admin Content page (/admin/content). Users can select 'Layout'
from the Operations Links to quickly edit an entity's layout.
