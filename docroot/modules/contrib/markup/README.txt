INTRODUCTION
------------

This module adds the ability for site admins to add "Markup" widgets to the
form. These essentially let designers of cck content-types insert additional
markup into the node/edit form to display to content-authors. This is the
equivalent of adding additional elements to $form of the type '#markup'.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

No special requirements.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit:
https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
for further information.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration.

However, in order to add this functionality, travel to a content type and chose
to add a field.  From the dropdown labeled "Add a new field", select
"Markup".  You can now add additional markup within the WYSIWYG for that
content type.
