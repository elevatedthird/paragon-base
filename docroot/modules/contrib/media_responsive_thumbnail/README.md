# Media Responsive Thumbnail

Media Responsive Thumbnail combines the Media module with the Responsive Image
module by adding a new field formatter which takes advantage of both functions.

Basically, it lets you display a Media Entity Reference field just like an
Image field with a Responsive Image formatter.


## Requirements

This module requires the following Core modules:

- Media
- Responsive Image


## Installation
 
- Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
information, see
[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).


## Configuration

- Navigate to your Media reference field (or create a new one if needed).
- Under "Manage display", select "Responsive thumbnail" as the formatter.
- In the formatter settings (cogwheel icon on the right)
  select the desired Responsive Image style to display the image.
